THIS IS THE GENERAL REPOSITORY FOR THE EBD PYTHIA AI DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, ALL SUB-PROJECTS WILL BE MANAGED THROUGH ADDITIONAL REPOSITORIES. Pythia AI is built on a propriatary modularand and selectively dissociative AI architecture which relies primarily on constructive Learning principles and recursive modeling along with selevctive dissociation and variable feedback between subcomponent systems to allow for the emergence of genral purpose AI to develop strong Artificial General Intelligence.
